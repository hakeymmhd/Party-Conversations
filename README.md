# Party-Conversations

In a party, there are X introverts, Y friends and Z gossipers.

1)The introverts will only talk to 1 other person (can be anyone) in the party.
2)The friends will talk with each other and any others who want to talk to them.
3)The gossipers will try to talk with everyone (including themselves) who would talk with them.

Write a program that will take 3 values. X, Y and Z, and it will compute both the minimum and the maximum number of conversations that would take place in the party.

State your assumptions if unclear.
